FBCheckIn
=========

A clean, focussed solution for facebook checking into facebook.

Why?
---

Facebook's native iOS app, though really great, does not focus on the check-in experience as a core feature. This app addresses this by creating a clean end to end check-in experience not too unlike foursquare.

[22:28] <micrypt> jaequery: It's entirely possible I've just run into the 5.2-using bunch. Just wondered. Thanks.
[22:28] <aristid> micrypt: you would think they'd have updated by now
[22:28] <micrypt> aristid: Yeah, they move really slowly.
[22:29] <aristid> micrypt: it's ridiculous IMHO

[22:30] <micrypt> aristid: It's safe to assume that they don't give a damn about supporting "new" things.

[22:36] <micrypt> Teja: Looks nice. I'm not on a Facebook so I'll probably skip installing it. If you don't mind, I'll have to give any opinion at all based on the preview shots…
[22:36] <mheld> micrypt: especially inpetto
[22:36] <micrypt> Death to Chanserv!!! O_O

[22:38] == mode/#startups [+o ChanServ] by rowling.freenode.net
[22:38] <micrypt> Teja: Alright then. I figure you built this partly because you wanted/need it. You might want to spend a bit more time polishing the UI if you want others to try it out. Part of why Facebook's apps are popular is that they do look nice.
[22:38] == ChanServ [ChanServ@services.] has quit [*.net *.split]
[22:38] <micrypt> Teja: Things like cutting off the location names nicely rather than placing buttons over them… adding borders between distinct UI components.
[22:39] <micrypt> Hmm… seems like Chanserv's having a rough day.

[22:40] <Teja> @micrypt Any specific things I can change ? I agree it doesn't feel as polished as Facebook Photos / Messenger .. which was what I was going for when I started building the app..

[22:41] <Teja> missed that message

[22:41] <karstensrage> seems ok, not really a big n'sync fan though
[22:43] <Teja> micrypt: Yeah, agree with both. I could probably make them pretty quickly. I'll think it through, prolly clean it up a little more ..
[22:43] <micrypt> mheld: OK. You started this. http://youtu.be/Eo-KmOd3i7s

[22:44] <jaequery> and have a nice looking homepage
[22:45] <jaequery> you need the help of media to get any more exposure to your app

[22:49] <jaequery> basically you can list your site up there, and then other companies like, makeuseof.com and hundred others will pick it up
[22:49] <Teja> I'll try find it.
[22:49] <jaequery> if you pay like $200 it expedites your listing

[22:53] <Teja> Thanks a bunch for the help guys! I'm on a holiday in Istanbul right now, time to head out and stop worrying about the app for a bit :)
[22:53] <jaequery> if your site gets listed, it'll guarantee (at least from my experience) your listing and reviews on sites like makeuseof.com and bunch of others .. should give you up to 50k/month traffic for next 3-4 months
